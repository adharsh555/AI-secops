# 🔐 AI-SecOps: Real-Time Threat Detection for AI Pipelines
AI-SecOps is a next-generation security layer designed specifically for AI/LLM applications. It protects your AI endpoints from emerging threats like prompt injection, model abuse, data exfiltration, and high-frequency misuse — all in real time.

🚫 Not just network security — this is intelligent, AI-native defense.

🔍 Key Features (Phase 1)
API Key Authentication: Gate access with trusted credentials

Granular Logging & Monitoring: Know who, when, and how your AI is accessed

Modular Design: Built to evolve with layered security phases

🎯 Why it matters:
Classic firewalls weren't built for prompt injection. AI-SecOps was.

If you're running, scaling, or deploying LLMs — you need a defense system built for the AI era.
